1. compile_forward should become compile and *args, **kwargs should get serialized too
2. decompose tests correctly into different file so that python test.py or something does all of them
3. support no caffe installation
4. support caffe installation because it's quicker
5. solvers, solver states, etc (make a class 'solver', lasagne probably has something like this already)
6. work with datasets
