TODO:
1. better serialization
2. mean images!
3. decompose tests correctly into different file so that python test.py or something does all of them
4. support no caffe installation
5. support caffe installation because it's quicker
6. solvers, solver states, etc (make a class 'solver', lasagne probably has something like this already)
7. work with datasets
conv layer pad?
dropout layer


WHAT I DID:
1. pylearn2 change (sparse connectivity, group), 2 changes
2. download google buffers, wget caffe.proto
3. protoc -I=. --python_out=. ./caffe.proto
